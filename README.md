# Burger Devourer

Burger Devourer is a fun and interactive application that allows users to add burgers to the page that they wish to devour. The name of the burger will be populated on the left column of the page with a corresponding "Devour" button. The user can then click this button to devour the burger. The now-devoured burger will then move to the right column of the page which stores the names of all devoured burgers.

The application is made using Node.js, MySQL, Bootstrap CSS, and jQuery. The application features an ORM which performs the MySQL queries. 

A link to the live version of the application is found here:
